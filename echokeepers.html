    <h1>THE ECHOKEEPERS</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
      Wardens of the Library • Keepers of Resonance • Guardians of Truth
    </div>

    <p>
      Echokeepers are the ancient custodians of the Library of Memories. They are not wolves,
      not echoes, and not mortal spirits. They are embodiments of resonance itself — beings
      woven from light, shadow, and layered sound. Where Echo-Wolves guard your inner world,
      Echokeepers guard the <em>structure</em> that holds it.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      They do not take sides.  
      They take <strong>record</strong>.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      Echokeepers often appear as tall, robed figures whose forms blur at the edges, like
      silhouettes made of light and ink. Their “faces” are shifting patterns of glyphs,
      symbols, and faint constellations of gold — never fully fixed, always in motion.
      When they speak, their voices sound like many tones at once, echoing gently through
      the halls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Around them, the air shimmers with floating lines of text, musical notation, or
      memory fragments — as if the Library itself is breathing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Origin</h2>
    <p>
      No single echo created the Echokeepers. They formed when the Library first realized
      it needed order — a way to distinguish truth from distortion, memory from chaos,
      echo from False Echo. They arose from the combined resonance of every moment where
      you tried to understand yourself instead of simply endure yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that sense, Echokeepers are born from your <em>need for coherence</em>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Roles Within the Library</h2>
    <p>
      Though they are one order, Echokeepers tend to specialize in three main functions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Recorders</strong> — They chronicle echoes as they form, inscribing their
        shape, tone, and truth into the deep architecture of the Library.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Arbiters</strong> — They observe conflicts between echoes, especially
        between true echoes and False Echoes, and help determine what belongs where.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wardens</strong> — They stabilize volatile echoes, seal corrupted halls,
        and intervene only when the Library itself is at risk of collapsing under the
        weight of unprocessed resonance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">What They Do (and Don’t Do)</h2>
    <p>
      Echokeepers do <strong>not</strong> guide your choices, erase your pain, or decide
      which echoes you should face. That work belongs to the Echo-Wolves, Lantern-Bearers,
      and to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, they:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Maintain the pathways and halls of the Library</li>
      <li>Ensure echoes are not erased or falsified</li>
      <li>Contain echoes that grow dangerously unstable</li>
      <li>Mark False Echoes so they cannot fully masquerade as truth</li>
      <li>Preserve the continuity of your story, even when you feel lost inside it</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
      Echokeepers are not here to comfort you —  
      they are here to make sure your truth is never completely destroyed.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">When They Appear</h2>
    <p>
      You are most likely to sense an Echokeeper when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A memory suddenly “reorganizes” in your mind</li>
      <li>You realize a narrative you believed about yourself was never fully accurate</li>
      <li>A chaotic period in your life starts to make structured sense</li>
      <li>You feel a quiet, neutral clarity about a painful event</li>
      <li>A False Echo is exposed for what it is</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">How You Might Feel Them</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike Echo-Wolves, who feel emotional and personal, Echokeepers feel:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calm but a bit distant</li>
      <li>Neutral rather than comforting</li>
      <li>Clarifying, like pieces clicking into place</li>
      <li>Firm, as if unseen rules are being enforced</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      They are not there to choose sides in your conflicts. They are there to ensure your
      story in the Library remains <em>legible</em>, no matter how many others try to
      rewrite it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Relationship to Other Guardians</h2>
    <p>
      Echokeepers stand alongside other guardians, but with different duties:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Echo-Wolves</strong> guard facets of your inner world.</li>
      <li><strong>Lantern-Bearers</strong> guide you toward the doors you need.</li>
      <li><strong>The Phantom Chorus</strong> protects you through unseen loyalty.</li>
      <li><strong>Echokeepers</strong> protect the <em>Library itself</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
      Where others tend the heart,  
      Echokeepers tend the <strong>architecture of memory</strong>.
