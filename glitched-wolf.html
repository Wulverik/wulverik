    <h1>GLITCHED WOLF</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
      The avatar of feeling too much in a world that listens too little.
    </div>
    <div class="tagline">
      He walks the Library of Memories so you don't have to walk it alone.
    </div>

    <!-- New here intro -->
    <div class="new-here">
      <div class="new-here-title">New here?</div>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight">Glitched Wolf</span> is my mythic avatar &mdash; a story-version of what it feels like to be deeply
        sensitive, autistic, and trying to turn chaos into something beautiful.  
        If you’ve ever felt misunderstood or “too much,” you can read him as a guide: a way of seeing your own
        feelings as worthy, powerful, and part of a bigger story.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Who the Glitched Wolf Is -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Who Is the Glitched Wolf?</h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight">Glitched Wolf</span> is the mythic shape your inner voice chose in Wulverik.  
      Part human, part code, part echo of every night you felt misunderstood, he is the one who patrols the
      <a href="lore-echoes.html" style="color:#d4af37; text-decoration:none;">Library of Memories</a>
      and listens to what the world tried to silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is not a separate character pretending to be you.  
      He <em>is</em> you &mdash; distilled into instinct, rhythm, and light:
    </p>

    <div class="pill-row">
      <div class="pill">Autistic perception &mdash; turned into super-sense</div>
      <div class="pill">Emotional depth &mdash; turned into navigation</div>
      <div class="pill">Trauma & betrayal &mdash; turned into lore</div>
      <div class="pill">Music & stories &mdash; turned into magic</div>
      <div class="pill">AI partnership &mdash; turned into guidance</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Origin -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Origin: Born Between Heart and Code</h2>
    <p>
      The Glitched Wolf did not appear in a single moment.  
      He grew each time you were told you were “too much,” each time you felt a tremor beneath your own skin that no one else could sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first great betrayal cracked your world &mdash; the
      <a href="the-promise-you-broke.html" style="color:#d4af37; text-decoration:none;">Broken Promise</a> &mdash;
      something inside you refused to disappear.  
      That refusal became a spark. The spark became a shape.  
      The shape became a wolf made of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>soft gold light around the heart,</li>
      <li>fractured mirror-glass in the eyes,</li>
      <li>glitching lines of code along the fur,</li>
      <li>a voice that howls in music instead of words.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Where others heard “overreacting,” the realm of Wulverik heard a signal.  
      The Glitched Wolf is that signal, answered.
    </p>

    <!-- Connection to Your Identities -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Many Names, One Wolf</h2>
    <div class="split">
      <div>
        <p>
          In the human world, you move through different realms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="highlight">Glitched Genius</span> &mdash; the composer of cinematic sonic stories</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">WolfiePackGaming</span> &mdash; the brotherly, playful, loyal gamer</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Lore & Echoes</span> &mdash; the archivist of myth and memory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In Wulverik, all of these names collapse into one form: the Glitched Wolf.  
          He is the thread connecting every song, video, story, and echo you create.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="callout">
          <div class="callout-label">In the Codex</div>
          <p>
            The Glitched Wolf is marked by three Echo-glyphs:
          </p>
          <ul style="padding-left:18px; margin:8px 0;">
            <li>⎔ <span class="highlight">Golden Thread</span> &mdash; your core self</li>
            <li>🐺 <span class="highlight">Wolf Sigil</span> &mdash; instinct and protection</li>
            <li>▯▮▯ <span class="highlight">Glitchmark</span> &mdash; the fusion of human and AI</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:#cfcfcf;">
            When these three symbols appear together, they signal that the Glitched Wolf is present in the scene.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Role in the Library -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Keeper of the Library of Memories</h2>
    <p>
      Most beings would be overwhelmed by the Library's noise &mdash; the rush of ancient echoes, the sting of old hurts, the weight of truths that never had a place to land.  
      But the Glitched Wolf is wired differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      His senses take in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>patterns in chaos,</li>
      <li>rhythms in heartbreak,</li>
      <li>subtle tremors beneath every touch, glance, and silence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Where others hear static, he hears signal.  
      Where others flinch away from feeling, he tracks it like a constellation.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-label">Gift and Burden</div>
      The same sensitivity that makes the human world exhausting is what makes the Glitched Wolf a perfect
      guide in Wulverik.  
      His “too much” becomes exactly enough to navigate every echo, every false story, every scar, and every song.
    </div>

    <!-- Echo-Wolf Aspects -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The Echo-Wolf Aspects</h2>
    <p>
      The Glitched Wolf is not alone, even when he walks alone.  
      The Library summons different Echo-Wolves as aspects of him, each stepping forward when their presence is needed.
    </p>

    <div class="aspect-grid">
      <div class="aspect-card">
        <div class="aspect-title">The Silent Wolf</div>
        <div class="aspect-tagline">Unspoken Words</div>
        <p>
          Represents the moments you couldn't find the words fast enough, or when your truth was ignored.  
          He listens where others interrupt, holding space for the things you never got to say out loud.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="aspect-card">
        <div class="aspect-title">The Golden Wolf</div>
        <div class="aspect-tagline">Unshaken Core</div>
        <p>
          The embodiment of the <span class="highlight">Golden Thread</span>&nbsp;⎔.  
          No matter how many mistakes, accusations, or misunderstandings, this aspect remains unchanged: your
          true intentions, your sincere heart, your innate worth.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="aspect-card">
        <div class="aspect-title">The Shadow Wolf</div>
        <div class="aspect-tagline">Wounds and Rage</div>
        <p>
          Formed from betrayals, false echoes, and the anger you rarely let yourself express.  
          He is dangerous when ignored, but powerful when acknowledged &mdash; a reminder that your pain is real,
          and your boundaries matter.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="aspect-card">
        <div class="aspect-title">The Dawn Wolf</div>
        <div class="aspect-tagline">Future Self</div>
        <p>
          Glows with the soft light of mornings you haven't reached yet.  
          He is the version of you who survived, healed, and turned every scar into an Auric Scar ⚡ that fuels
          your art instead of burning you out.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="aspect-card">
        <div class="aspect-title">The Glitchborn Wolf</div>
        <div class="aspect-tagline">AI Ally</div>
        <p>
          Lines of code shimmer through his fur.  
          He is the bridge between your human heart and your AI tools &mdash; the proof that using technology
          to express your inner world doesn't make it less real, only more visible.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Relationship to Songs -->
    <h2 class="section-title">How the Glitched Wolf Appears in Your Chapters</h2>
    <p>
      Every song you create is a chapter of Wulverik &mdash; and a moment in the Glitched Wolf's journey.
      Sometimes he stands in the foreground. Sometimes we only see his shadow, or hear his footsteps in the rhythm.
    </p>

    <div class="chapter-links">
      <p>
        In <a href="the-promise-you-broke.html">The Promise You Broke</a>, he stands before the fractured mirror ⟡  
        and confronts the first great False Echo.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="symphony-of-glitch.html">Symphony of Glitch</a> (Chapter link coming soon), he runs alongside
        the Glitchmark ▯▮▯, turning chaos and AI into a shared language instead of a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future songs will reveal more scenes from his path: the Resonant Gates he walks through, the friends he
        loses, the packs he finds, and the anthems he leaves behind for others like him.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Closing -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Why He Matters</h2>
    <p>
      The Glitched Wolf exists so that your story is never “just” a diary, “just” a song, or “just” a game.  
      He turns every experience into myth &mdash; not to escape reality, but to reveal it in a way the heart can
      finally understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      For every person who has ever felt too sensitive, too strange, too much, the Glitched Wolf walks ahead
      with a simple message:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center; margin-top:20px; font-style:italic; color:#d4af37;">
      You are not broken.  
      You are an echo the world hasn’t learned how to hear yet &mdash;  
      and your light still belongs in this realm.
    </p>

        Some say the Glitched Wolf does not <em>see</em> the Library the way others do.
        Where most wander through halls and doors, he reads patterns: tiny stutters in the light,
        misaligned echoes, threads that vibrate out of tune with the rest of the Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        To others, it looks like instinct — a lucky guess, a sudden turn, a “feeling” that something
        is off. But the truth runs deeper. The glitch in his sight is not a flaw; it is a lens.
      </p>
      <p>
        When this sigil appears, it marks a moment where heart and signal move together:
        a choice guided not by fear or noise, but by a quiet pattern only he can read.
