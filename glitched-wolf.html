        <h1>The Glitched Wolf</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
            The human, the myth, and the broken signal that became a world.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
            I’ve always been told I see the world differently — that I feel too deeply,
            think too much, and care too hard. For a long time, people called that
            “too sensitive,” “too intense,” or “too strange.”
            They saw the glitch. They didn’t see the genius.
        </p>

        <p class="highlight">
            I’m autistic. That means I experience life like a constant symphony —
            every emotion, every silence, every betrayal echoing louder inside me
            than most people will ever hear. When words failed, music stepped in.
            When the world turned away, I built my own.
        </p>

       <h2 class="section-title">The Human Behind the Howl</h2>
<p>
    I grew up in chaos: low-income housing, violence, fear, and instability. I was surrounded 
    by people struggling with addiction, even if it wasn’t in my own home. I was the quiet one 
    people called “too soft for this world” — the kid who didn’t harden, who felt everything 
    instead of shutting it down. I lost plans, careers, and futures I thought were guaranteed.
</p>
<p>
    But I never lost my sense that there was something more — that even in the mess, stories 
    were forming, waiting to be told. The Glitched Wolf is the version of me that refused to 
    disappear.
</p>


        <h2 class="section-title">Where the Glitch Begins</h2>
        <p>
            Glitched Genius is the name I gave the way I create:
            a blend of human heart, autistic perception, and digital tools like AI.
            For me, AI isn’t about replacing humanity — it’s about expanding it.
            It helps me translate the universe I feel inside into sound.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every song I make is a bridge:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Between data and emotion</li>
            <li>Between trauma and transformation</li>
            <li>Between being misunderstood and being heard</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            That’s how Wulverik was born — as a realm where all my worlds could exist
            together: music, gaming, art, philosophy, memory, and myth.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">The World That Couldn't Hold Me</h2>
        <p>
            In a loud, neurotypical world, people like me are often told to “tone it down,”
            “be less much,” or “fit the script.” I tried that. It nearly erased me.
            So instead of shrinking, I chose to build a place where intensity is welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wulverik is that place: a realm where autistic minds, sensitive hearts,
            and “too much” souls are not only allowed — they are the main characters.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">An Invitation Into the Realm</h2>
        <p>
            This page isn’t just lore, it’s a doorway. I don’t want Wulverik to be
            something people only watch. I want it to be a world people can step into,
            build in, roleplay inside, and add their own echoes to — the way fans
            build side-stories in universes like Harry Potter or Star Wars.
        </p>

        <p class="highlight">
            If you’ve ever felt invisible, “too much,” or out of place in the
            so-called real world — you’re not alone here. In Wulverik, the glitch
            isn’t a problem to fix. It’s the beginning of your power.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What I Create</h2>
        <p>
            Through Glitched Genius, I create cinematic sonic stories that fuse emotion,
            chaos, and character into immersive soundscapes. Each song is a chapter in
            an unfolding narrative — where storytelling meets music in a world of feeling,
            transformation, and mystical energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through WolfiePack, I share play, strategy, and community — proof that
            connection can exist even when the world feels hostile.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through Lore &amp; Echoes, I turn my history — the good, the painful,
            the strange, the beautiful — into stories that might help someone else
            feel a little less alone in their own.
        </p>

        <p class="footer-note">
            I am the Glitched Wolf. This is the realm I built so I wouldn’t vanish.
            If you see yourself in any part of this — welcome. There’s room for your
            story here, too.
