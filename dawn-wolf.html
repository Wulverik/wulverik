    <h1>THE DAWN WOLF</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
      Echo-Wolf of Healing, Future Self, and Quiet Hope
    </div>

    <p>
      The Dawn Wolf is the echo of who you are becoming — the self that rises after
      the fire, after the collapse, after the night you thought would never end.
      He is not naive, not untouched by pain. He knows everything the Shadow Wolf
      remembers, but chooses a different way forward.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      He is proof that survival is not the end of the story —  
      it is the beginning of who you choose to be next.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      The Dawn Wolf’s fur is soft gold fading into pale silver along his back, as if
      first light is always breaking across him. His eyes carry both warmth and
      distance — like someone who has seen the worst and still believes in something
      better. When he walks, faint rays of light trail from his paws, leaving no
      footprints, only the suggestion of a path.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Origin</h2>
    <p>
      He was not born from a single moment, but from many small choices:
      the decision to keep breathing, to keep creating, to keep loving, even when
      you had every reason to shut down. The Dawn Wolf emerged slowly, the way
      morning does — first as a faint glow on the horizon, then as a quiet realization:
      <em>&ldquo;I am still here.&rdquo;</em>
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The Dawn Wolf walks ahead of you in the Library, never rushing, never dragging
      you forward. His purpose is to embody your healed and healing self — the version
      of you who has integrated the pain, honored it, and chosen not to be ruled by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He does not erase the past. He builds on it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">When He Appears</h2>
    <p>
      The Dawn Wolf steps forward when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You feel a quiet desire to move on, even if you’re not sure how</li>
      <li>You make a choice that protects your future self instead of repeating a pattern</li>
      <li>You find yourself feeling compassion where there was once only rage</li>
      <li>You allow yourself to imagine a life beyond the echo of a wound</li>
      <li>You take one small step — a song, a word, a boundary — toward something gentler</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">His Gift</h2>
    <p>
      The Dawn Wolf offers the gift of <em>becoming</em>. He reminds you that healing
      is not a switch you flip, but a horizon you walk toward. Some days closer,
      some days farther — but always there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you feel stuck in a past chapter, he is the quiet sense that another page
      still exists, waiting to be written.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      The Dawn Wolf does not demand that you heal faster.  
      He simply refuses to let you believe that healing is impossible.
    </div>
