    <h1>Origin of the Realm</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      This page was never meant to be found by everyone.  
      It exists for the travelers who listen between the lines,  
      and for the wolves who know what it means to be scattered  
      and still choose to rise.
    </p>

    <div class="origin-box">
      <p class="origin-text">
        There are truths that roar like thunder,
        and there are truths that whisper.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        Before Wulverik existed, before the first Echo woke, before the Glitched Wolf opened his golden eyes,
        there was only silence.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        Not the peaceful kind of silence, but the heavy kind — the kind that follows betrayal.  
        Voices twisted the truth. Trust shattered. A loyal heart was buried under lies
        too heavy for one soul to carry.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        Three shadows rose in that time — not storybook villains, but people who could not see the wolf
        standing before them. Their words were sharp. Their doubts were poison. Their fear was wildfire.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        And in that wildfire… the wolf burned.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        The puzzle of who he was — his kindness, his loyalty, his laughter, his honesty, his depth, his heart —  
        was torn apart and thrown into the dark. Not broken. Just scattered.
      </p>

      <div class="divider">✶ ✶ ✶</div>

      <p class="origin-text">
        But something happened that the shadows never planned for.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        The wolf did not disappear.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        Strangers gathered in the smoke, drawn not by obligation, but by heart.  
        They knelt beside the scattered pieces and picked them up, one by one.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        They did not ask him to be stronger. They did not tell him to “move on.”
        They did not say he was too sensitive. They did not blame him for hurting.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        Instead, they said:
        <br><em>“We see you.”</em>
        <br><em>“We hear you.”</em>
        <br><em>“We will walk with you.”</em>
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        Piece by quiet piece, hand by quiet hand, the wolf came back together.
        Not as he was — but as something more.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        The scattered puzzle did not reassemble into its old shape.  
        It evolved. It grew fangs made of truth, eyes made of gold,
        fur woven from pain alchemized into strength.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        From that rebirth, a realm opened its eyes.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        <strong>Wulverik.</strong> The Wolf That Evolves.
      </p>

      <div class="divider">✶ ✶ ✶</div>

      <p class="origin-text">
        This realm is carved from ashes and empathy.  
        A sanctuary forged from harm that did not win.  
        A story shaped by those who stayed.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        Here, Echoes become myth so they no longer haunt.  
        Here, scars glow instead of bleed.  
        Here, travelers who feel “too much” find their place.  
        Here, wolves who were abandoned find a pack.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        Wulverik is not the wolf’s escape from the world.  
        Wulverik is the world he built after the world tried to break him.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        Every traveler who enters this realm—knowingly or unknowingly—walks through the ashes of that fire  
        and rises in the gold of what survived.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        This realm exists because the wolf chose creation over collapse.  
        Because he chose to evolve.  
        Because strangers became companions and helped him place the last piece of the puzzle back into place.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        This is the origin.  
        Not of the wound —  
        but of the world born afterward.
      </p>

      <p class="origin-text">
        This is Wulverik.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="whisper">
      If you found this page, it means you were meant to know:  
      you were never just broken — only scattered.  
      And even scattered wolves can become realms.
    </p>
