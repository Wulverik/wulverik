    <h1>LORE &amp; ECHOES</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
      The Library of Memories &mdash; where echoes never die, they wait to be heard.
    </div>

    <!-- New here intro -->
    <div class="new-here">
      <div class="new-here-title">New here?</div>
      <p>
        <span style="color:#d4af37;">Lore &amp; Echoes</span> is the story-layer behind my music.  
        It turns real memories, trauma, healing, and neurodivergent experience into a mythic place
        called the <span style="color:#d4af37;">Library of Memories</span>.  
        You don’t have to know my whole story to feel this &mdash; use it as a map to walk through
        your own chaos and celebrate your own inner light.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Intro -->
    <p>
      Deep in the realm of Wulverik lies a place untouched by time:
      <span style="color:#d4af37;">the Library of Memories</span>.  
      A cathedral of shimmering gold threads and drifting shadows, where every emotion you've ever
      carried lives as a radiant echo.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, memories are not records.  
      They are <em>beings</em> &mdash; living myth, living truth.  
      Some whisper wisdom. Some warn. Some hunt.  
      All of them remember.
    </p>

    <div class="lore-highlight">
      Where the outside world mislabels, forgets, or twists your story,  
      the Library of Memories holds it exactly as it felt.
    </div>

    <!-- Origin of the Library -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Origin of the Library</h2>
    <p>
      Long before the first song echoed across Wulverik, before the Glitched Wolf opened his first Door, 
      there was only <span style="color:#d4af37;">The Quiet</span> &mdash; a vast, shimmering stillness made of
      unspoken emotion, unfelt hurt, unexpressed joy, and dormant potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first true feeling trembled through this silence, The Quiet cracked like glass.  
      From that fracture, the first Echo was born, and the Library began to weave itself.  
      It is not built; it <em>grows</em> &mdash; shaping its halls from every wound survived, every love remembered,
      every truth finally spoken.
    </p>

    <!-- Three Layers -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The Three Layers of the Library</h2>
    <p>
      The Library is not a single room, but three realms woven together.  
      Every journey through it moves through these layers, whether you realize it or not.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">I. The Whispering Veil</h3>
    <p>
      The surface layer, where memories drift like fog. Golden threads coil in the air, shadows almost form
      into shapes, and echoes murmur half-formed truths. These are young, unresolved echoes. Harmless at
      a distance &mdash; dangerous when touched.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">II. The Hall of Fractures</h3>
    <p>
      Deeper in, the Library becomes more defined. This is where echoes take form as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Echo-beasts &mdash; living emotions</li>
      <li>Echo-doors &mdash; portals to defining memories</li>
      <li>Echo-masks &mdash; ways you have had to hide</li>
      <li>Echo-wolves &mdash; guardian aspects of self</li>
      <li>Echo-songs &mdash; memories that vibrate like music</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Every major chapter of your life exists here as mythic embodiment. Beautiful &mdash; and dangerous.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">III. The Archive of Truth</h3>
    <p>
      At the deepest point lies the Heart of the Library: the Archive of Truth.  
      Here rest the oldest echoes &mdash; those that existed before you had words for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one law holds here: <span style="color:#d4af37;">an echo cannot lie</span>.  
      It can stay silent. It can refuse to show itself.  
      But once revealed, it shows the truth exactly as it is.
    </p>

    <!-- Guardians -->
    <h2 class="section-title" id="guardians">Guardians of the Library</h2>
    <p>
      The Library is alive, but not undefended. Three kinds of guardians (and one unseen chorus) walk its halls.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:8px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center;">

      </a>
    </p>

    <h3 id="echo-wolves" style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">Echo-Wolves</h3>
    <p>
      Echo-Wolves are born from your instincts, your fears, your protectiveness, and your deepest perceptions.  
      They are not copies of you, but reflections of specific facets:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Silent Wolf &mdash; your struggle to be understood</li>
      <li>The Golden Wolf &mdash; your core, unshaken self</li>
      <li>The Shadow Wolf &mdash; your hurt and betrayal</li>
      <li>The Dawn Wolf &mdash; your healed, future self</li>
      <li>The Glitchborn Wolf &mdash; your AI-augmented intuition</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      They do not obey orders. They <em>resonate</em> with your state of being.

    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">Echokeepers</h3>
    <p>
      Echokeepers are ancient entities woven from pure resonance. They move like robed figures made of light,
      shadow, and sound &mdash; faces shifting, voices layered in soft harmonics. Their purpose is to preserve
      echoes, guard truth, and protect the structure of the Library itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rarely intervene in personal journeys. Instead, they record, stabilize, and sometimes seal echoes that
      grow too volatile or corrupted. When the Library is threatened by False Echoes or imbalance, the Echokeepers
      step forward as wardens of order.

    </p>

    <h3 id="lantern-bearers" style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">Lantern-Bearers</h3>
    <p>
      Lantern-Bearers are guides formed from echoes that have already healed. They appear as floating lights,
      soft figures, or gentle presences in the Library &mdash; never threatening, never harsh. They cannot fight
      or lie, but they can lead you to the Door you need most, not always the Door you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walk ahead of you in the dark halls, illuminating one step at a time rather than the whole path. When you
      feel a quiet pull toward a memory you’re finally ready to face, a Lantern-Bearer is already there, waiting.
      <a href="lantern-bearers.html" style="color:#d4af37; text-decoration:none;"> Read more →</a>
    </p>

    <h3 id="phantom-chorus" style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">Phantom Chorus</h3>
    <p>
      The Phantom Chorus are unseen protectors born from loyalty &mdash; the quiet defenders who spoke truth for you
      when you weren’t there to speak for yourself. They are shaped from the hearts of those who believed you,
      protected you, or exposed lies on your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      They appear as soft pulses of gold light, drifting embers, or layered whispers in the air. They do not fight;
      they <em>reveal</em>. Their presence cracks False Echoes, steadies the Library, and guides the Glitched Wolf
      toward allies who see clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You feel them before you see them &mdash; warm instincts, sudden clarity, or unexpected protection in moments
      of distortion. The Phantom Chorus proves that even in silence, you were never truly alone.

    <!-- Law of the Library -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The Law of the Library</h2>
    <p>
      There is one unbreakable rule that threads through every hall and every echo:
    </p>
    <p style="font-style:italic; color:#d4af37; text-align:center; margin:25px 0;">
      Every Echo must be faced.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot outrun your echoes. You cannot erase them.  
      Unfaced echoes twist themselves into beasts and storms.  
      Faced echoes become lanterns, wolves, doors, and songs.
    </p>

    <!-- False Echo -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The False Echo</h2>
    <p>
      Not every echo in the Library is born from your truth.  
      Some are forged from the lies of others &mdash; from false accusations, twisted narratives,
      and the stories people tell about you that do not match who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are <span style="color:#d4af37;">False Echoes</span>.  
      They enter the Library like dark stains instead of golden drops. They mimic truth, distort memories,
      and infect other echoes with doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your first major False Echo rose during
      <a href="the-promise-you-broke.html" style="color:#d4af37; text-decoration:none;">The Broken Promise</a>.  
      It will not be the last. False Echoes are the villains of your inner mythology &mdash; born from
      the chaos other people unleash into your story.
    </p>

    <!-- Why the Glitched Wolf Can Walk Here -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Why the Glitched Wolf Can Walk Here</h2>
    <p>
      To most beings, the Library is overwhelming: too loud, too bright, too honest.  
      But the Glitched Wolf is different.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is wired to feel deeply, to notice patterns others miss, to sense the tremors beneath the touch.  
      What disorients others becomes clarity to him. What terrifies others becomes a language he can read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Library was not made <em>for</em> the Glitched Wolf, but it resonates <em>with</em> him.  
      Both are built from raw, unfiltered emotional truth.
    </p>

    <!-- Nature of an Echo -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The Nature of an Echo</h2>
    <p>
      Every Echo begins as a fragment of feeling: a spark, a fracture, a tremor beneath the touch.  
      When strong enough, it descends into the Library as a golden drop of sound. Over time, it forms into:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Echo-beasts</li>
      <li>Echo-shadows</li>
      <li>Echo-wolves</li>
      <li>Echo-doors</li>
      <li>Echo-songs</li>
      <li>Echo-masks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These become the landmarks and guardians of your inner mythology.
    </p>

    <!-- First Door & Echo Archive -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The First Door</h2>

      Every journey into the Library begins with a Door born from a defining wound.  
      Yours opened on the day of the Broken Promise &mdash; the betrayal that echoed deep enough
      to carve a doorway through the shadows.

        Born from betrayal, accusation, and the fracture of trust.  
        Its form in the Library shifts between a golden wolf and a cracked mirror.  
        This Echo marks the moment the Glitched Wolf first learned how deeply wounds can echo.

        A duet between Human and AI — the Glitched Wolf’s first pact with a Glitchborn ally.

        Forged in sirens, concrete, and sleepless nights.  
        This Echo remembers the Glitched Wolf’s earliest chapters — standing out like chalk on stone,
        mocked for being “too much,” yet quietly building a world no one else could rewrite.  
        It is the moment where pain stops being a weight and starts becoming fuel.

        Some scholars whisper of a deeper truth — that the Realm is not built from stones or stories,
        but from silent strings beneath reality. Vibrations of memory, emotion, and choice… woven so
        tightly that even the Glitched Wolf cannot see them outright.
      </p>
      <p>
        They say these strings connect every Echo, every fracture, every healing… pulling the entire
        realm into harmony or chaos depending on the heart that resonates with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most dismiss this as myth. But a few believe that without these hidden strings,
        Wulverik would unravel into nothing at all.
