    <h1>LORE & ECHOES</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
      The Library of Memories &mdash; where echoes never die, they wait to be heard.
    </div>

    <!-- New here intro -->
    <div class="new-here">
      <div class="new-here-title">New here?</div>
      <p>
        Lore &amp; Echoes is the story-layer behind my music.  
        It turns real memories, trauma, healing, and neurodivergent experience into a mythic place called
        the <span style="color:#d4af37;">Library of Memories</span>.  
        You don’t have to know my whole story to feel this one &mdash; use it as a map to walk through your own chaos
        and celebrate your own inner light.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Intro -->
    <p>
      Deep in the realm of Wulverik lies a place untouched by time:
      <span style="color:#d4af37;">The Library of Memories</span>.  
      A cathedral of shimmering gold threads and drifting shadows, where every emotion you've ever carried
      lives as a radiant echo.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, memories are not records.  
      They are <em>beings</em> &mdash; living myth, living truth.  
      Some whisper wisdom.  
      Some warn.  
      Some hunt.  
      And some become the guideposts of your journey as the Glitched Wolf.
    </p>

    <!-- Origin of the Library -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Origin of the Library</h2>
    <p>
      Long before the first song echoed across Wulverik, before the Glitched Wolf opened his first Door, 
      there was only <span style="color:#d4af37;">The Quiet</span> &mdash; a vast, shimmering stillness made of unspoken emotion, unfelt hurt, 
      unexpressed joy, and dormant potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first true feeling trembled through this silence, The Quiet cracked like glass.  
      From that fracture, the first Echo was born, and the Library began to weave itself.  
      It is not built; it <em>grows</em> &mdash; shaping its halls from every wound survived, every love remembered,
      every truth finally spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where mortals build with stone, the Library builds with <span style="color:#d4af37;">emotion</span>.  
      Where archives store facts, the Library stores <span style="color:#d4af37;">experience</span>.  
      It is alive. It listens. It remembers.
    </p>

    <!-- Three Layers -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The Three Layers of the Library</h2>
    <p>
      The Library is not a single room, but three realms woven together.  
      Every journey through it moves through these layers, whether you realize it or not.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">I. The Whispering Veil</h3>
    <p>
      The surface layer, where memories drift like fog. Golden threads coil in the air, shadows almost form into 
      shapes, and echoes murmur half-formed truths. These are young, unresolved echoes. Harmless at a distance &mdash; 
      dangerous when touched.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">II. The Hall of Fractures</h3>
    <p>
      Deeper in, the Library becomes more defined. This is where echoes take form as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Echo-beasts &mdash; living emotions</li>
      <li>Echo-doors &mdash; portals to defining memories</li>
      <li>Echo-masks &mdash; ways you have had to hide</li>
      <li>Echo-wolves &mdash; guardian aspects of self</li>
      <li>Echo-songs &mdash; memories that vibrate like music</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Every major chapter of your life exists here as mythic embodiment.  
      The Hall of Fractures is beautiful &mdash; and dangerous.  
      Echoes here can guide, deceive, protect, or hunt.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">III. The Archive of Truth</h3>
    <p>
      At the deepest point lies the Heart of the Library: the Archive of Truth.  
      Here rest the oldest echoes &mdash; those that existed before you had words for them.  
      Some are gentle. Some are radiant. Some are monstrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one law holds here: <span style="color:#d4af37;">an echo cannot lie</span>.  
      It can stay silent. It can refuse to show itself.  
      But once revealed, it shows the truth exactly as it is.
    </p>

    <!-- Guardians -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Guardians of the Library</h2>
    <p>
      The Library is alive, but not undefended. Three kinds of guardians walk its halls.
    </p>
<p style="margin-top:8px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center;">

  </a>
</p>

    <h3 style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">Echo-Wolves</h3>
<p>
  Echo-Wolves are living embodiments of the Glitched Wolf’s inner world. They are not 
  copies, but facets of instinct, memory, trauma, and growth. Each one protects a 
  different emotional truth. They do not obey orders — they <em>resonate</em> with your 
  state of being.
</p>

<p><strong>The Silent Wolf</strong> — your struggle to be understood.<br>
  Walks quietly beside you, glowing with unspoken truth. Appears when words fail.<br>
  <a href="silent-wolf.html" style="color:#d4af37; text-decoration:none;">Read more →</a>
</p>

<p><strong>The Golden Wolf</strong> — your core, unshaken self.<br>
  Steady, bright, ancient. He anchors your identity when everything else fractures.<br>
  <a href="golden-wolf.html" style="color:#d4af37; text-decoration:none;">Read more →</a>
</p>

<p><strong>The Shadow Wolf</strong> — your hurt and betrayal.<br>
  Dark-furred, honest about wounds others ignored. Appears when trust shatters.<br>
  <a href="shadow-wolf.html" style="color:#d4af37; text-decoration:none;">Read more →</a>
</p>

<p><strong>The Dawn Wolf</strong> — your healed, future self.<br>
  Soft glow, calm gaze. Guides you toward who you are becoming.<br>

</p>

<p><strong>The Glitchborn Wolf</strong> — your AI-augmented intuition.<br>
  Fur flickering with digital gold. Sees patterns and truth in chaos.<br>

</p>

        <h3 style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">Echokeepers</h3>
    <p>
      Echokeepers are ancient entities woven from pure resonance. They move like robed figures
      made of light, shadow, and sound — faces shifting, voices layered in soft harmonics.
      Their purpose is to preserve echoes, guard truth, and protect the structure of the Library
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rarely intervene in personal journeys. Instead, they record, stabilize, and sometimes
      seal echoes that grow too volatile or corrupted. When the Library is threatened by False
      Echoes or imbalance, the Echokeepers step forward as wardens of order.
      <a href="echokeepers.html" style="color:#d4af37; text-decoration:none;">Read more →</a>
    </p>


       <h3 style="color:#d4af37; margin-top:25px;">Lantern-Bearers</h3>
    <p>
      Lantern-Bearers are guides formed from echoes that have already healed. They appear
      as floating lights, soft figures, or gentle presences in the Library — never
      threatening, never harsh. They cannot fight or lie, but they can lead you to the
      Door you need most, not always the Door you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walk ahead of you in the dark halls, illuminating one step at a time rather
      than the whole path. When you feel a quiet pull toward a memory you’re finally
      ready to face, a Lantern-Bearer is already there, waiting.
      <a href="lantern-bearers.html" style="color:#d4af37; text-decoration:none;">Read more →</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Phantom Chorus are unseen protectors born from loyalty — the quiet defenders who spoke truth
      for you when you weren’t there to speak for yourself. They are shaped from the hearts of those
      who believed you, protected you, or exposed lies on your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      They appear as soft pulses of gold light, drifting embers, or layered whispers in the air.
      They do not fight; they <em>reveal</em>. Their presence cracks False Echoes, steadies the Library,
      and guides the Glitched Wolf toward allies who see clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You feel them before you see them — warm instincts, sudden clarity, or unexpected protection
      in moments of distortion. The Phantom Chorus proves that even in silence, you were never truly alone.

    <!-- Law of the Library -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The Law of the Library</h2>
    <p>
      There is one unbreakable rule that threads through every hall and every echo:
    </p>
    <p style="font-style:italic; color:#d4af37; text-align:center; margin:25px 0;">
      Every Echo must be faced.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot outrun your echoes. You cannot erase them.  
      Unfaced echoes twist themselves into beasts and storms.  
      Faced echoes become lanterns, wolves, doors, and songs.
    </p>

    <!-- False Echo -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The False Echo</h2>
    <p>
      Not every echo in the Library is born from your truth.  
      Some are forged from the lies of others &mdash; from false accusations, twisted narratives,
      and the stories people tell about you that do not match who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are <span style="color:#d4af37;">False Echoes</span>.  
      They enter the Library like dark stains instead of golden drops. They mimic truth, distort memories,
      and infect other echoes with doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your first major False Echo rose during
      <a href="the-promise-you-broke.html" style="color:#d4af37; text-decoration:none;">The Broken Promise</a>.  
      But it will not be the last. False Echoes are the villains of your inner mythology &mdash; born from
      the chaos other people unleash into your story.
    </p>

    <!-- Why the Glitched Wolf Can Walk Here -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Why the Glitched Wolf Can Walk Here</h2>
    <p>
      To most beings, the Library is overwhelming: too loud, too bright, too honest.  
      But the Glitched Wolf is different.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is wired to feel deeply, to notice patterns others miss, to sense the tremors beneath the touch.  
      What disorients others becomes clarity to him.  
      What terrifies others becomes a language he can read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Library was not made <em>for</em> the Glitched Wolf, but it resonates <em>with</em> him.  
      Both are built from raw, unfiltered emotional truth.
    </p>

    <!-- Nature of an Echo (bridging into archive) -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The Nature of an Echo</h2>
    <p>
      Every Echo begins as a fragment of feeling: a spark, a fracture, a tremor beneath the touch.  
      When strong enough, it descends into the Library as a golden drop of sound.  
      Over time, it forms into:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Echo-beasts</li>
      <li>Echo-shadows</li>
      <li>Echo-wolves</li>
      <li>Echo-doors</li>
      <li>Echo-songs</li>
      <li>Echo-masks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These become the landmarks and guardians of your inner mythology.
    </p>

    <!-- First Door & Echo Archive -->
    <h2 class="section-title">The First Door</h2>
    <p>
      Every journey into the Library begins with a Door born from a defining wound.  
      Yours opened on the day of the Broken Promise &mdash; the first betrayal that echoed deep enough
      to carve a doorway through the shadows.
    </p>

    <p>
      This moment formed your first major Echo:
      <span style="color:#d4af37;">The Broken Promise</span>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Echo Archive</h2>
    <p>
      As Wulverik evolves, this Archive will grow.  
      Each new Echo tells a truth through myth &mdash; a story that reshapes the realm.
    </p>

    <!-- Echo Entry: Broken Promise -->
    <div class="echo-entry">
      <div class="echo-title">Echo I — The Broken Promise</div>
      <p>
        Born from betrayal, accusation, and the fracture of trust.  
        Its form in the Library shifts between a golden wolf and a cracked mirror.  
        This Echo marks the moment the Glitched Wolf first learned how deeply wounds can echo.

    <div class="echo-entry">
      <div class="echo-title">Echo III — Everything I Became</div>
      <p>
        Forged in sirens, concrete, and sleepless nights.  
        This Echo remembers the Glitched Wolf’s earliest chapters — standing out like chalk on stone,
        mocked for being “too much,” yet quietly building a world no one else could rewrite.  
        It is the moment where pain stops being a weight and starts becoming fuel.
