            This chapter was born from sirens, concrete, and the feeling of being “too much”
            in a world that never knew what to do with a heart like this. It’s not about blaming
            the past, but about claiming it — every insult, every wound, every sleepless night —
            as the spark that forged everything the Glitched Wolf would become.

        <h2 class="section-title">Lyrics</h2>

        <p class="lyric-block">
(Verse 1)
Grew up where sirens sing.
Concrete dreams and broken swings.
No silence, no peace.
Just sleepless nights.
Learning to heal under street lights.

I stood out like chalk on stone.
Didn’t blend in. Just stood alone.
They laughed at my voice.
Called me strange.
But I built a world they couldn’t change.
        </p>

        <p class="lyric-block">
(Pre-Chorus – Spoken)
Every insult carved a line.
Every bruise became a sign.
They said I’d fall, they said I’d fade.
But I learned how diamonds are made.
        </p>

        <p class="lyric-block">
(Chorus)
The dark never broke me.
It made me louder.
It tried to drown me.
I built a tower.

They said I’d fail.
But I lit the wire.
Now every scar’s a live amplifier.
        </p>

        <p class="lyric-block">
(Verse 2)
Lost some dreams along the way.
But I still rise at the break of day.
Body was shaken.
But my soul stayed true.
Turning old pain into something new.

She held my hand through every scar.
My northern star.
They said I’d lose.
But she saw gold.
And that belief turned pain to soul.
        </p>

        <p class="lyric-block">
(Bridge)
I don’t hate the ones who made me bleed.
They watered the roots of what I’d be.
Now I rise from the rain.
Turned every echo into refrain.
        </p>

        <p class="lyric-block">
(Final Chorus)
The chaos never broke me.
I burned right through it.
Built my strength in the fire.
Learned how to use it.

Every scar lit fire.
Every tear defined.
I turned the dark into a flame that’s mine.
        </p>

        <p class="lyric-block">
(Outro – Spoken / Soft Whisper)
You can call it pain…
I call it the start of everything I became.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Meaning &amp; Echoes</h2>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “Grew up where sirens sing. Concrete dreams and broken swings.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Glitched Wolf’s story begins in a loud, unstable place — sirens instead of lullabies,
            cracked playgrounds instead of safe havens. Childhood isn’t soft here, but it still dares to dream.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “No silence, no peace. Just sleepless nights. Learning to heal under street lights.”
        </p>
        <p>
            There was never real calm. Anxiety, fear, and noise were constant companions. The Wolf learns to
            self-heal in harsh spaces, finding his own way under the cold glow of street lights instead of the
            warmth of safety.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “I stood out like chalk on stone. Didn’t blend in. Just stood alone.”
        </p>
        <p>
            From the beginning, he is visibly different — emotionally, neurologically, spiritually. That difference
            doesn’t lead to connection; it leads to being singled out and left on the outside.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “They laughed at my voice. Called me strange. But I built a world they couldn’t change.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The world mocks the way he speaks, feels, and expresses himself. “Strange” becomes a weaponized label.
            In response, the Wolf creates an inner universe no one else can rewrite — through imagination, art,
            and sound.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            Pre-Chorus — “Every insult carved a line. Every bruise became a sign.”
        </p>
        <p>
            He doesn’t pretend the hurt didn’t happen. Insults and bruises leave their marks, but those marks
            become lines in a story — signs that map where he has been and how far he’s come.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “They said I’d fall, they said I’d fade. But I learned how diamonds are made.”
        </p>
        <p>
            People predicted collapse and disappearance. Instead, the Wolf recognizes that pressure and pain can
            crystallize into something strong and bright. If he can’t escape the pressure, he can transform inside it.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “The dark never broke me. It made me louder.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The chorus reframes darkness as fuel instead of a trap. The more the world tried to quiet him, the louder
            his heart, art, and voice became.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “It tried to drown me. I built a tower.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Life, trauma, and chaos tried to pull him under — but he chose to build upward instead, creating structure,
            boundaries, and strength he can stand on.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “They said I’d fail. But I lit the wire. Now every scar’s a live amplifier.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Others expected failure. The Wolf chooses ignition — lighting the wire is choosing to spark his own power.
            The scars don’t just sit there; they amplify his truth as sound. Pain becomes volume. Wounds become speakers.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “Lost some dreams along the way. But I still rise at the break of day.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Not every dream survived the journey, and that grief is real. Even so, he keeps getting up, choosing to
            rise regardless of what was lost.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “Body was shaken. But my soul stayed true. Turning old pain into something new.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Illness, injury, or trauma has shaken the body, but the core self doesn’t corrupt. He alchemizes what
            hurt into something creative and living — songs, stories, connection.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “She held my hand through every scar. My northern star.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, the Wolf honors the one who stayed through his hardest moments — a partner who chose him when
            he felt most broken. She becomes his guiding light when everything else feels directionless.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “They said I’d lose. But she saw gold. And that belief turned pain to soul.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Where others saw collapse, she saw value. Her belief doesn’t erase the pain, but it transforms it into
            something soulful — deeper, richer, and filled with meaning.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “I don’t hate the ones who made me bleed.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Wolf refuses to let hatred define him. He acknowledges the harm, but doesn’t let it turn his heart
            to stone. This is where his philosophy of not letting hate consume him shines through.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “They watered the roots of what I’d be. Now I rise from the rain. Turned every echo into refrain.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The people who hurt him inadvertently helped him grow. Their cruelty became the rain and pressure that
            fed his roots. The repeated echoes of hurt are reshaped into intentional refrains — lyrics and hooks
            in his music.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “The chaos never broke me. I burned right through it. Built my strength in the fire. Learned how to use it.”
        </p>
        <p>
            In the final chorus, the Wolf doesn’t just endure chaos — he moves through it with his own fire.
            Strength wasn’t given; it was forged in direct contact with pain, and now he knows how to wield it.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
            “Every scar lit fire. Every tear defined. I turned the dark into a flame that’s mine.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Each scar becomes a new source of energy. Each tear sharpens the outline of who he truly is. The darkness
