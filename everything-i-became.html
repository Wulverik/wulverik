      the isolation — and refuses to call it just “damage.” Instead, it names those nights as the forge where
      everything was formed.

<span class="lyric-block">
(Verse 1)
Grew up where sirens sing.
Concrete dreams and broken swings.
No silence, no peace.
Just sleepless nights.
Learning to heal under street lights.

I stood out like chalk on stone.
Didn’t blend in. Just stood alone.
They laughed at my voice.
Called me strange.
But I built a world they couldn’t change.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Pre-Chorus – Spoken)
Every insult carved a line.
Every bruise became a sign.
They said I’d fall, they said I’d fade.
But I learned how diamonds are made.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Chorus)
The dark never broke me.
It made me louder.
It tried to drown me.
I built a tower.

They said I’d fail.
But I lit the wire.
Now every scar’s a live amplifier.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Verse 2)
Lost some dreams along the way.
But I still rise at the break of day.
Body was shaken.
But my soul stayed true.
Turning old pain into something new.

She held my hand through every scar.
My northern star.
They said I’d lose.
But she saw gold.
And that belief turned pain to soul.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Bridge)
I don’t hate the ones who made me bleed.
They watered the roots of what I’d be.
Now I rise from the rain.
Turned every echo into refrain.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Final Chorus)
The chaos never broke me.
I burned right through it.
Built my strength in the fire.
Learned how to use it.

Every scar lit fire.
Every tear defined.
I turned the dark into a flame that’s mine.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Outro – Spoken / Soft Whisper)
You can call it pain…
I call it the start of everything I became.

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “Grew up where sirens sing. Concrete dreams and broken swings.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          The Glitched Wolf’s story begins in a loud, unstable place — sirens instead of lullabies,
          cracked playgrounds instead of safe havens. Childhood isn’t soft here, but it still dares to dream.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “No silence, no peace. Just sleepless nights. Learning to heal under street lights.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          There was never real calm. Anxiety, fear, and noise were constant companions. The Wolf learns to
          self-heal in harsh spaces, finding his own way under the glow of street lights instead of safety.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “I stood out like chalk on stone. Didn’t blend in. Just stood alone.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          From the beginning, he is visibly different — emotionally, neurologically, spiritually. That difference
          doesn’t lead to connection; it leads to being singled out and left on the outside.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “They laughed at my voice. Called me strange. But I built a world they couldn’t change.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          The world mocks the way he speaks, feels, and expresses himself. “Strange” becomes a weaponized label.
          In response, the Wolf creates an inner universe no one else can rewrite — through imagination, art,
          and sound.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          Pre-Chorus — “Every insult carved a line. Every bruise became a sign.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          He doesn’t ignore the damage. Insults and bruises leave marks, and those marks become signposts of
          survival — reminders of how far he has come.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “They said I’d fall, they said I’d fade. But I learned how diamonds are made.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          People predicted collapse and disappearance. Instead, the Wolf recognizes that pressure and pain can
          crystallize into something strong. If he cannot escape the pressure, he can transform inside it.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “The dark never broke me. It made me louder.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          Darkness becomes fuel rather than failure. The more life tried to mute him, the stronger and clearer
          his voice became.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “It tried to drown me. I built a tower.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          When life, trauma, and chaos tried to pull him under, he chose to build upward — creating structure,
          boundaries, and a vantage point he could rise from.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “They said I’d fail. But I lit the wire. Now every scar’s a live amplifier.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          Lighting the wire represents choosing ignition — choosing action. Each scar now amplifies his truth,
          transforming wounds into sound.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “Lost some dreams along the way. But I still rise at the break of day.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          Some dreams didn’t survive, and the grief is real. Yet he continues to rise every day — choosing
          persistence over surrender.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “Body was shaken. But my soul stayed true. Turning old pain into something new.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          Trauma shook the body, but the inner self remained aligned. Old pain is repurposed into creativity,
          expression, and connection.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “She held my hand through every scar. My northern star.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          Here, he honors the one who stayed — the partner who brought stability during chaos. She becomes
          his guiding light in the darkest moments.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “They said I’d lose. But she saw gold. And that belief turned pain to soul.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          Where others predicted loss, she saw worth. Her belief transforms his suffering into something
          soulful and meaningful.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “I don’t hate the ones who made me bleed.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          The Wolf refuses to let hatred consume him. He acknowledges the harm without letting it harden his heart.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “They watered the roots of what I’d be. Now I rise from the rain. Turned every echo into refrain.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          Those who hurt him unintentionally nourished his growth. Their echoes are reshaped into refrains —
          structured art instead of uncontrolled pain.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “The chaos never broke me. I burned right through it. Built my strength in the fire. Learned how to use it.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          The final chorus shifts from survival to mastery. Strength wasn’t inherited — it was forged through fire,
          and now he knows how to wield it.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          “Every scar lit fire. Every tear defined. I turned the dark into a flame that’s mine.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          Scars become fuel. Tears define identity. Darkness becomes a controlled flame — the Wolf’s own
          source of power and purpose.
        </p>

        <p class="meaning-quote">
          Outro — “You can call it pain… I call it the start of everything I became.”
        </p>
        <p class="meaning-text">
          Others may see only damage. The Glitched Wolf sees origin. The darkest moments form the
          spark that ignited his entire becoming — the genesis of Glitched Genius.
        </p>
      </section>
    </div>

    <p class="footer-note">
      “Everything I Became” stands at the core of the Glitched Wolf’s mythology — the moment where pain
      stops being a wound and becomes a weapon of creation, opening a Resonant Gate ⟊ into the artist he is now.
