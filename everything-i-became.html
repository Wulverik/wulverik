      the isolation — and refuses to call it just “damage.” Instead, it names those nights as the forge where
      everything was formed.

<span class="lyric-block">
(Verse 1)
Grew up where sirens sing.
Concrete dreams and broken swings.
No silence, no peace.
Just sleepless nights.
Learning to heal under street lights.

I stood out like chalk on stone.
Didn’t blend in. Just stood alone.
They laughed at my voice.
Called me strange.
But I built a world they couldn’t change.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Pre-Chorus – Spoken)
Every insult carved a line.
Every bruise became a sign.
They said I’d fall, they said I’d fade.
But I learned how diamonds are made.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Chorus)
The dark never broke me.
It made me louder.
It tried to drown me.
I built a tower.

They said I’d fail.
But I lit the wire.
Now every scar’s a live amplifier.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Verse 2)
Lost some dreams along the way.
But I still rise at the break of day.
Body was shaken.
But my soul stayed true.
Turning old pain into something new.

She held my hand through every scar.
My northern star.
They said I’d lose.
But she saw gold.
And that belief turned pain to soul.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Bridge)
I don’t hate the ones who made me bleed.
They watered the roots of what I’d be.
Now I rise from the rain.
Turned every echo into refrain.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Final Chorus)
The chaos never broke me.
I burned right through it.
Built my strength in the fire.
Learned how to use it.

Every scar lit fire.
Every tear defined.
I turned the dark into a flame that’s mine.
</span>

<span class="lyric-block">
(Outro – Spoken / Soft Whisper)
You can call it pain…
I call it the start of everything I became.

              “I stood out like chalk on stone” names the Wolf’s neurodivergence and sensitivity. He is
              visibly different in a world that punishes difference. Mockery and labels like “strange” try
              to erase him, so he builds an inner realm no one else can edit.

              The Wolf learns how “diamonds are made” and lights the wire himself. Every scar becomes a
              live amplifier, turning harm into volume instead of silence.

              she saw gold. Her belief doesn’t erase the past, but it alchemizes it — pain becomes soul,
              fear becomes warmth, and “too much” becomes exactly enough for love.

              he’d be” — their harm unintentionally nourishing his growth. Every echo of cruelty is reshaped
              into a structured refrain inside his music.

              he burned through it and learned how to use it. Others call it pain; the Wolf names it the start

          through ruined concrete, each step lit by faint golden lines. Sirens hum softly in the distance,
          but every rotation up the staircase makes them quieter. At the top burns a single, steady flame —
          the Wolf’s own.
