        <p class="subtitle">
            Chapter I of the Glitched Wolf’s journey — a song of fractured trust, truth, and becoming.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
            This chapter was born from a broken bond — not to call anyone out, but to honor what it feels
            like when loyalty is misread as “too much,” and truth is twisted into a lie. It is the moment
            the Glitched Wolf realized that even the deepest hurt can become a spark.

                <p>
                    <strong>(Verse 1)</strong>
                    You said you’d be my voice. When the world turned away.<br>
                    I thought our friendship was something that would stay.<br>
                    I trusted you with truth, gave light through the pain.<br>
                    But you called my care obsession, like I was insane.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(Pre-Chorus)</strong>
                    You said I was wrong.<br>
                    That my friendship was chained.<br>
                    But what you called clingy was me fighting the pain.<br>
                    We were going through.<br>
                    I cared and checked in on you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(Chorus – with Drop)</strong>
                    You said I was lying, but my heart stayed true.<br>
                    You twisted my words till I barely knew.<br>
                    You called it clingy, I called it loyal.<br>
                    Now the ones who whispered the lies, are in the dark.<br><br>

                    You sacrificed friendship.<br>
                    Someone who was true.<br>
                    Next time, you should get the full story through.<br>
                    Ask me for proof before you choose your view.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(Verse 2)</strong>
                    I gave you my fears, but you let them drown.<br>
                    You smiled through the cracks while tearing me down.<br>
                    I held on tight through your stormy disguise.<br>
                    But you cut the rope and left me to rise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(Bridge)</strong>
                    You made me doubt my world, my voice, my spark.<br>
                    But I’m still standing.<br>
                    Rebuilding from dark.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(Final Chorus)</strong>
                    You said I was lying, but my truth remains.<br>
                    I’m done with your story, your guilt, your chains.<br>
                    You said you’d be my voice.<br>
                    Now I sing alone.<br>
                    Because of you, your mark is now my spark.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>(Outro – The Promise)</strong>
                    I will keep my promise, though we’ve drifted apart.<br>
                    I will leave the door open, it’s carved in my heart.<br>
                    The pain still whispers, but I’ll bear the mark.<br>
                    I am keeping my promise.<br>
                    A candle lit in the dark.
                </p>

            <div class="breakdown-block">
                <h2 class="section-title">Meaning &amp; Echoes</h2>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“You said you’d be my voice. When the world turned away.”</span><br>
                    Someone once promised to stand beside the Wolf — to defend him, speak for him, and understand
                    him when others did not. It felt like loyalty. It felt like safety.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“I thought our friendship was something that would stay.”</span><br>
                    This is the hope that a rare connection will last — the belief that this bond is different.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“I trusted you with truth… But you called my care obsession.”</span><br>
                    Vulnerability meets misinterpretation. Care is twisted into “clinginess,” loyalty into
                    something unstable. The hurt begins here.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">Pre-Chorus — “what you called clingy was me fighting the pain…”</span><br>
                    The Wolf wasn’t clinging out of weakness, but out of empathy — trying to support someone
                    they cared about through shared pain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“You said I was lying, but my heart stayed true.”</span><br>
                    False accusations cut deeper than distance. This line holds the ache of being called a liar
                    when you know you’ve been honest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“You twisted my words till I barely knew.”</span><br>
                    This reflects gaslighting energy — when your reality gets twisted so much that you start to
                    doubt your own perception.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“You called it clingy, I called it loyal.”</span><br>
                    The core contrast of the song: two different interpretations of the same behavior. One sees
                    burden. The other sees devotion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“Now the ones who whispered the lies, are in the dark.”</span><br>
                    Rumors and whispers feel powerful in the moment, but they don’t last. Truth doesn’t always
                    shout, but it survives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“You sacrificed friendship. Someone who was true.”</span><br>
                    The pain of realizing that the other person chose one-sided stories over the relationship you
                    were actually living.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“I gave you my fears, but you let them drown.”</span><br>
                    Opening up about fears and trauma — and watching them sink because the other person couldn’t
                    or wouldn’t hold them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“You smiled through the cracks while tearing me down.”</span><br>
                    A gentle mask hiding sharp edges. The disconnect between how someone presents and how their
                    choices actually feel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“But you cut the rope and left me to rise.”</span><br>
                    The turning point. Being abandoned hurts — but it also forces growth. The Wolf learns to stand
                    without their support.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">Bridge — “You made me doubt my world, my voice, my spark.”</span><br>
                    When someone you trust questions your reality, it can shake your sense of self. This line
                    names that collapse.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“But I’m still standing. Rebuilding from dark.”</span><br>
                    This is the rise — quiet, stubborn resilience. Not pretending it didn’t hurt, but choosing to
                    rebuild anyway.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="breakdown-label">“Because of you, your mark is now my spark.”</span><br>
                    The alchemy of pain. The wound becomes fuel. The mark they left becomes the fire that drives
                    the Wolf forward.
                </p>

                    The Wolf remains loyal to who he is, even if the other person is gone. The door is open, but
                    he won’t knock. The candle symbolizes a promise kept without expectation — a quiet act of
                    love, and a refusal to let hate win.

            “The Promise You Broke” is not about revenge — it’s about recognition. If you’ve ever been painted as
            “too much,” “too clingy,” or “the villain” for caring deeply, this chapter is for you. Your loyalty
            was never the problem. The wrong story was.
