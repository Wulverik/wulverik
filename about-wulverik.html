        <h1>Wulverik: The Threshold Realm</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
            The origin of a world for those who feel too much — and the doorway into it.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Before It Had a Name</h2>
        <p>
            Before Wulverik was a word, it was a feeling — a soft place beneath a loud life.
            A quiet hum under the chaos, a second reality just out of reach. Most people never
            notice it. They move through the noise and call it normal.
        </p>
        <p>
            But some of us hear everything. We feel everything. We carry the world in colors
            and echoes others don’t see. We live with one foot in the physical world and one
            foot in something deeper.
        </p>

        <p class="highlight">
            Wulverik is that deeper place — not an escape from reality, but a translation of it.
            A realm where all the parts of you that never fit the script finally have room to exist.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">The Glitch as Doorway</h2>
        <p>
            The doorway to Wulverik is not a wardrobe, or a mirror, or a stone arch in a forest.
            It’s a glitch — a flicker in the way reality feels. A moment when the regular world
            becomes too loud, too sharp, too heavy, and something inside you whispers:
            <em>There has to be more than this.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            In that moment, the air changes. Noise falls away. The edges of the day blur. You’re
            still here, but not only here. You’ve stepped sideways — into a realm built for hearts
            like yours.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Forged by a Glitched Wolf</h2>
        <p>
            Wulverik was forged by a Glitched Wolf — a guardian born from chaos, sensitivity,
            music, and memory. A being who refused to numb out the pain, and instead turned
            every echo into a story.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where others saw “too sensitive,” the Glitched Wolf saw signal. Where others saw
            “too intense,” the Wolf saw power. Where others demanded silence, the Wolf
            carved out a place where feeling deeply wasn’t a flaw — it was the whole point.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">The Realms That Formed</h2>
        <p>
            As the Glitched Wolf howled into the dark, the realm shaped itself into four currents:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Glitched Genius</strong> — the sonic core, where music becomes map and emotion becomes energy.</li>
            <li><strong>WolfiePack</strong> — the packfire, where play, strategy, and community keep the night warm.</li>
            <li><strong>Lore &amp; Echoes</strong> — the codex, where memories unfold into myth and scars become story.</li>
            <li><strong>The Glitched Wolf</strong> — the self between worlds, the one who guides others through the threshold.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Together, these realms form Wulverik — a living world growing alongside the one who created it, and the ones who choose to enter.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Who This World Calls</h2>
        <p>
            Wulverik doesn’t shout for attention. It doesn’t trend. It doesn’t beg to be seen.
            It calls quietly to the ones who were never meant to be quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
            It calls to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ones who feel “too much” in a world that feels too little.</li>
            <li>The ones who see patterns in chaos and stories in scars.</li>
            <li>The autistic minds, sensitive hearts, and restless souls who were told to shrink.</li>
            <li>The creators who want to build, roleplay, and weave their own sub-realms inside a living story.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="highlight">
            Here, the glitch is not a malfunction. It’s a key. Here, the wolf is not a monster.
            It’s a guide. Here, your difference is not an error — it’s your entrance.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Crossing the Threshold</h2>
        <p>
            Stepping into Wulverik isn’t about leaving the real world behind. It’s about shedding
            what was never really yours — the masks, the shame, the demand to be smaller than
            your own truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other side of the threshold, there is still pain. There are still storms.
            But there is also language for it. There is music for it. There are stories that turn
            isolation into recognition and struggle into shared myth.
        </p>

        <p class="footer-note">
            If you are reading this, you’ve already found the edge of the wardrobe, the crack in
            the wall, the glitch in the sky. You are standing at the threshold of Wulverik.
            Step through. The realm has been waiting for you.
