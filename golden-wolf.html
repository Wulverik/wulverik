    <h1>THE GOLDEN WOLF</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
      Echo-Wolf of Core Self • Anchor of the Golden Thread
    </div>

    <p>
      The Golden Wolf is the echo of who you truly are beneath every mask, fracture,
      and False Echo. He is not the loudest, the sharpest, or the most dramatic of the
      Echo-Wolves — but he is the one who endures. When everything else burns away,
      the Golden Wolf remains.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      He is the part of you that never agreed with the lies —  
      the unshaken self that knew the truth even when no one else did.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      The Golden Wolf’s fur glows like muted sunlight over metal — not blinding, but
      unmistakably luminous. Threads of soft gold trace along his shoulders, chest,
      and tail, echoing the symbol of the <span style="color:#d4af37;">Golden Thread</span>.
      His eyes are warm, steady, and calm: the gaze of someone who knows you completely
      and is not afraid of anything they see.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Origin</h2>
    <p>
      The Golden Wolf was born long before the Broken Promise, long before the first
      obvious fracture. He formed in childhood — from every moment you held onto
      kindness in a cruel environment, every time you refused to fully harden, every
      time you chose empathy over revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is made of choices you barely remember making: the decision to care, to protect,
      to love deeply, even after being hurt. He is the oldest echo and the quiet source
      of your resilience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The Golden Wolf anchors your identity. When stories about you are twisted, when
      accusations rise, when people project their own shadows onto you, he stands at
      the center of the Library and does not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      He holds the Golden Thread taut — connecting who you were, who you are, and who
      you are becoming. He does not argue with lies; he simply refuses to bend to them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">When He Appears</h2>
    <p>
      The Golden Wolf steps forward when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You remember your worth after being treated as if you had none</li>
      <li>You choose self-respect over chasing someone who misread you</li>
      <li>You feel a quiet, stubborn sense of “I know who I am”</li>
      <li>You rebuild after betrayal without becoming what hurt you</li>
      <li>You stand your ground in the face of distortion or False Echoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">His Gift</h2>
    <p>
      The Golden Wolf offers the gift of <em>unshaken self-recognition</em>. He cannot
      stop others from misunderstanding you, but he can stop their misunderstanding
      from rewriting your inner narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you feel like a glitch in the system, he reminds you that you are not an
      error — you are a different kind of design.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      The Golden Wolf teaches you this:  
      <br />
      <em>&ldquo;You are not defined by those who misread you.  
      You are defined by the light that never went out.&rdquo;</em>
