    <h1>LANTERN-BEARERS</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
      Guides of Healed Echoes • Keepers of Gentle Light
    </div>

    <p>
      Lantern-Bearers are guides formed from echoes that have already healed. They are not
      warriors, judges, or enforcers. They are what remains when a memory has been faced,
      felt, and integrated — the soft light that lingers after the storm.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      They do not force you through doors.  
      They simply stand beside the ones you are finally ready to open.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      Lantern-Bearers usually appear as floating lights, softly glowing figures, or
      silhouettes carrying small lanterns that pulse like steady heartbeats. Their light is
      never blinding, only warm — enough to show you the next few steps, not the entire
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes they resemble past versions of yourself, loved ones, or anonymous
      companions made of light. Their exact form matters less than the feeling they bring:
      a quiet, gentle <em>it’s okay to look now</em>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Origin</h2>
    <p>
      A Lantern-Bearer is born whenever an echo completes a full cycle of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Being felt instead of denied</li>
      <li>Being understood instead of feared</li>
      <li>Being accepted as part of your story</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once an echo no longer needs to roar, haunt, or hunt, it can soften into guidance.
      From that softened echo, a Lantern-Bearer emerges — carrying the light of what you’ve
      learned so others (and future you) can find their way more easily.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Lantern-Bearers do not alter the Library or protect its structure. Their work is
      focused entirely on you — the wanderer walking the halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      They:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lead you toward echoes you are ready to face</li>
      <li>Guide you away from halls you are not yet strong enough to enter</li>
      <li>Help you find doors of closure, release, or understanding</li>
      <li>Illuminate paths that connect different echoes into a clearer story</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
      A Lantern-Bearer will never drag you forward.  
      They wait until you choose to follow.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">When They Appear</h2>
    <p>
      You are most likely to sense a Lantern-Bearer when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You feel a gentle nudge to revisit a memory that once felt unbearable, but now
        feels… approachable.
      </li>
      <li>
        A song, image, or phrase leads you back to a moment in your life with more
        compassion than before.
      </li>
      <li>
        You suddenly understand a past event from a kinder, wiser angle.
      </li>
      <li>
        You notice that a story which once triggered you now feels more like a story than
        an open wound.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">How They Feel</h2>
    <p>
      Lantern-Bearers carry a specific emotional signature:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calm without being numb</li>
      <li>Gentle without being passive</li>
      <li>Honest without being overwhelming</li>
      <li>Encouraging without pressuring you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      They are the feeling of a deep breath you didn’t know you were holding. The quiet
      sense that maybe — just maybe — you’re ready to look at something that once terrified
      you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Relationship to Other Guardians</h2>
    <p>
      Within the Library:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Echo-Wolves</strong> represent facets of your inner world.</li>
      <li><strong>Echokeepers</strong> maintain the structure of the Library.</li>
      <li><strong>The Phantom Chorus</strong> watches over you through unseen loyalty.</li>
      <li><strong>Lantern-Bearers</strong> guide your <em>steps</em> between it all.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
      Where Echo-Wolves roar and the Shadow Wolf remembers,  
      Lantern-Bearers simply lift a light — and wait for you to move.
    </div>
