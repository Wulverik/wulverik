    <h1>THE PHANTOM CHORUS</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
      Unseen Protectors • Guardians of Loyalty • Voices Behind the Quiet
    </div>

    <p>
      The Phantom Chorus is the order of unseen protectors that surrounds the Glitched Wolf
      whenever truth is under attack. They are not Echo-Wolves, not Echokeepers, and not
      Lantern-Bearers. They are formed from something rarer:
      <strong>the loyalty of others.</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      Every time someone defended you when you weren’t there to defend yourself,  
      a voice joined the Phantom Chorus.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">What They Are</h2>
    <p>
      The Phantom Chorus is made of all the unseen, unheard acts of protection in your story:
      friends who spoke up, cousins who exposed lies, quiet witnesses who refused to accept
      a false version of you. In the realm of Wulverik, those moments don’t vanish — they
      gather, resonate, and take on a collective form.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are not individual characters so much as a living harmony. Where Echo-Wolves
      embody parts of you, the Phantom Chorus embodies the people who truly saw you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      The Phantom Chorus rarely appears as solid figures. Instead, they are sensed as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clusters of small, golden heartbeats drifting in the air</li>
      <li>Soft voices layered together in a distant harmony</li>
      <li>Faint silhouettes standing just beyond the light</li>
      <li>Swirls of warm energy moving as if a crowd walked beside you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Their symbol is the <span style="color:#d4af37;">Phantom Chorus glyph (ღ)</span> — a mark of unseen community
      and quiet protection.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Origin</h2>
    <p>
      The Phantom Chorus formed the first time someone defended your name in your absence.
      When a lie was told about you and another heart said, “That’s not who they are,” a
      new voice joined the Chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew stronger through:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Friends who believed you over rumors</li>
      <li>People who stood up to False Echoes</li>
      <li>Those who saw your heart clearly and refused to stay silent</li>
      <li>Acts of protection you never knew about at the time</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
      You felt alone — but the Phantom Chorus proves you were never completely unguarded.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The Phantom Chorus does not control the Library or your choices. Their work is subtle
      but powerful:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>They destabilize lies.</strong>  
        When a False Echo spreads, the Chorus vibrates against it, exposing fractures and
        inconsistencies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>They shield your name.</strong>  
        In unseen spaces, they counter the narratives that try to erase who you really are.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>They amplify truth.</strong>  
        When you or others speak honestly, their resonance strengthens that moment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>They guide you toward allies.</strong>  
        They tilt your path toward those who already see you clearly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">When They Appear</h2>
    <p>
      You are most likely to sense the Phantom Chorus when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You learn that someone defended you behind the scenes or years after an event.
      </li>
      <li>
        You feel unexpectedly supported during a moment of accusation or distortion.
      </li>
      <li>
        A lie about you begins to collapse under its own weight.
      </li>
      <li>
        You encounter evidence that your story was protected without your knowledge.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In the Library of Memories, they may appear as a sudden swell of soft voices, a ring
      of lights gathering around the Glitched Wolf, or a comforting presence in otherwise
      empty halls.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">How They Feel</h2>
    <p>
      The emotional signature of the Phantom Chorus is distinct:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A sense of being “held” even when physically alone</li>
      <li>A quiet reassurance that someone, somewhere, understands</li>
      <li>A feeling that you are not crazy for remembering things the way you do</li>
      <li>A strange peace when truth starts to surface on its own</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
      The Phantom Chorus doesn’t erase the hurt —  
      they remind you that your worth was never defined by those who hurt you.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Relationship to Other Guardians</h2>
    <p>
      Within Wulverik:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Echo-Wolves</strong> embody your internal facets and instincts.</li>
      <li><strong>Echokeepers</strong> guard the structure and order of the Library.</li>
      <li><strong>Lantern-Bearers</strong> guide your steps toward healing.</li>
      <li><strong>The Phantom Chorus</strong> surrounds you with unseen loyalty.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Where others protect your inner world or the Library itself, the Phantom Chorus
      protects the <em>truth of how you were loved and defended</em>, even when you couldn’t see it.
