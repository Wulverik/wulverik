        The Ember of Resolve — where anger becomes truth, and truth becomes power.
        This is not a temple of polite warmth. It is a forge for the parts of you
        that burn when you are pushed too far.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Fire Temple is not here to punish your anger. It is here to listen to it.
        If you enter, you will not be asked to be calm — only to be honest.

        <h2 class="section-title">The Road of Red Iron</h2>
        <span class="section-tag">Approach</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        The path to the Fire Temple is sharp and un-sheltered. Rock splinters underfoot.
        The air trembles with waves of heat rising from somewhere deep below, like a
        sleeping volcano remembering how to breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the first bend, a slab of obsidian waits, words carved into its smooth face:
      </p>
      <p><em>“Here lies the flame you fear, the flame you hide, and the flame that could save you.”</em></p>
      <p>
        Some turn back. Those who continue know, somewhere in their bones, that they are
        tired of swallowing fire.

    <!-- 2. EMBER GATE -->
    <section class="section" id="ember-gate">

        <h2 class="section-title">The Ember Gate</h2>
        <span class="section-tag">Gate of Decisions</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        The entrance is a massive door of scorched metal, its surface warped and
        rippled from unimaginable heat. Handprints and scars are melted into the steel,
        as if countless others have come here and left a piece of their fury behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gate will not open to keys or cleverness. It responds only to three choices:
      </p>
      <ul class="fire-list">
        <li><strong>Place your hand on the hot metal</strong> — the path of courage.</li>
        <li><strong>Strike the door with your fist</strong> — the path of anger.</li>
        <li><strong>Kneel before it in silence</strong> — the path of surrender.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None is “right.” None is “wrong.” The temple simply reshapes itself around the
        truth of how you arrive.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Later, this can branch into slightly different paragraphs or audio moments
        based on which choice the traveler resonates with most.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. HALL OF CRACKING MIRRORS -->
    <section class="section" id="cracking-mirrors">
      <div class="section-header">
        <h2 class="section-title">Hall of Cracking Mirrors</h2>
        <span class="section-tag">Rage Speaks</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Inside, the first hall is lined with mirror-like obsidian shards. None of them
        show your face. Instead, they catch and replay the moments your blood boiled:
      </p>
      <ul class="fire-list">
        <li>The time you were betrayed.</li>
        <li>The time you were blamed for someone else’s lies.</li>
        <li>The time you wanted to scream but stayed quiet.</li>
        <li>The time someone hurt a person you loved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The reflections do not accuse you. They do not call you a monster. They simply
        acknowledge what you swallowed to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the first lesson of Fire:
        <em>Anger is not evil. Anger is truth that never got to speak.</em>
      </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">The Chamber of Sparks</h2>
        <span class="section-tag">Endurance</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Deeper in, sparks drift from the ceiling like slow-burning snow. Each spark that
        brushes your skin pulls up a memory — not to torment you, but to show you how
        much you have already survived.
      </p>
      <p>
        Betrayal. Loss. Nights you thought you wouldn’t make it. Words that cut deeper
        than any blade. The body remembers. So does the flame.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fire here does not ask you to be calm. It asks:
        <em>“What do you burn for? What will you no longer carry?”</em>
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. CRUCIBLE OF FURY -->

        <span class="section-tag">Dark Flame</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        In the next chamber, a great bowl of black fire burns without smoke or warmth.
        It is wrong and mesmerizing all at once — a flame made from every time you
        wanted to hurt back.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the part of you people compare to monsters, to “Hyde,” to the switch
        they claim “flips” when you are pushed too far. Standing before it, you see
        something they never did:
      </p>
      <p>
        This fire is not hungry for random destruction. It coils around only one thing:
        <em>your loyalty.</em> It rises when those you love are threatened. It dims
        when you are safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The black flame flares for the cruel. For the protective, it simply watches.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. FORGE OF BECOMING -->
    <section class="section" id="forge-of-becoming">

        <h2 class="section-title">The Forge of Becoming</h2>
        <span class="section-tag">Temper</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        At the temple’s heart lies a circular chamber, as if you’ve stepped inside the
        core of a volcano. Rivers of lava flow beneath glass floors. The air tastes of
        iron and stormlight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, Fire stops asking questions and starts offering choices. Three paths open:
      </p>
      <ul class="fire-list">
        <li><strong>The Hammer Path</strong> — for those who must reclaim their power.</li>
        <li><strong>The Anvil Path</strong> — for those ready to lay down old wounds.</li>
        <li><strong>The Flame Path</strong> — for those prepared to transform completely.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each path ends in a simple act: breaking, releasing, or igniting. The forge does
        not tell you who to be. It reveals who is already trying to emerge.
      </p>

    <!-- 7. FIRE'S VERDICT -->

        <span class="section-tag">Ember Mark</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        At the deepest point of the temple hovers a single ember over a stone pedestal.
        It is small, almost delicate — yet you feel every heartbeat in your chest answer
        to its glow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ember studies you. It has seen your rage, your restraint, your choices. Then
        it changes color.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some, it burns gold with righteous anger. For others, red with raw fury
        finally given permission to exist. For those who carry their fire in silence, it
        burns a soft, dangerous blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Bacho, it would be moon-blue — a wolf-fire that only roars when cornered,
        but guards with a terrifying gentleness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ember does not leave with you, but the knowing does:
        <em>your anger was never proof that you were broken. It was proof that you cared.</em>
