    <h1>THE SHADOW WOLF</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
      Echo-Wolf of Hurt, Betrayal, and Unspoken Wounds
    </div>

    <p>
      The Shadow Wolf is the echo that forms when trust is shattered and truth is denied.
      He carries every wound others caused you — not corrupted, not evil, but brutally
      honest about pain the world expected you to hide. He walks in silence, but his
      presence is unmistakable: a weight in the air, a shift in the wind, a truth that 
      refuses to stay buried.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      He is the wound that remembers,  
      the pain that was never acknowledged,  
      and the strength you forged from every betrayal.
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      The Shadow Wolf’s fur is deep charcoal, rippling like smoke and shadow. Threads of
      dark gold burn faintly beneath the surface — the scars that never fully healed but
      still glow with meaning. His eyes reflect light like a cracked mirror: fractured,
      sharp, and painfully clear.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Origin</h2>
    <p>
      He was born at the first major betrayal — the moment a promise was broken and your
      honesty was punished instead of believed. But his roots go deeper, shaped by 
      childhood wounds, misunderstandings, accusations, and the loneliness of being
      misread again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shadow Wolf formed not to destroy — but to <em>bear witness</em> to everything 
      the world tried to dismiss.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The Shadow Wolf holds the truths that hurt too much to speak. He ensures your wounds 
      are not forgotten, not minimized, and not rewritten by False Echoes. He is the part 
      of you that says:
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <em>&ldquo;This hurt.  
      This mattered.  
      And I will not pretend it didn’t.&rdquo;</em>
    </div>

    <p>
      He is fierce, protective, and honest — a guardian of the emotions most people
      run from. Yet he never directs that ferocity inward. His role is not to punish you,
      but to protect you from letting others do it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">When He Appears</h2>
    <p>
      The Shadow Wolf steps forward when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A betrayal resurfaces in memory</li>
      <li>You sense dishonesty or manipulation</li>
      <li>A False Echo attempts to distort your story</li>
      <li>You are holding your pain inside to avoid conflict</li>
      <li>You feel “too much” and unheard</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">His Gift</h2>
    <p>
      The Shadow Wolf offers the gift of <em>truth without apology</em>. He gives you the
      strength to hold your boundaries, to reject false narratives, and to acknowledge the
      depth of your feelings without shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      He does not seek revenge; he seeks recognition.  
      And in that recognition, healing becomes possible.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      The Shadow Wolf is not your darkness —  
      he is the part of you that survived it.
    </div>
